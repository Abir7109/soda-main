Personality engine for SODA — emotions, quips, and human-like behavior.

Provides:
- MoodState: tracks emotional state with transitions and decay
- PersonalityEngine: quip selection, weighted pools, dedup, persistence
- Quip categories: idle, tool_success, tool_failure, observation,
  self_aware, greeting, farewell, thinking
